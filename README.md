# Crowdsale schedule

## Crowdsale schedule modification ##

The internal phases schedule can be manipulated at any time by the owner with following methods:
```
function extendSaleTime() onlyOwner public {
  require(!saleActive());
  require(!extended);
  require(supply() >= threshold);
  extended = true;
 Â endDate += 60 days;
}
```
