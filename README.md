# AIgatha Contracts (A draft document)
AIgatha Ethereum contracts consist of
+ AIgathaToken contract - the coin supposed to be the main digital asset in AIgatha application; emits XXXs to investors during Presale and Publicsale phases.

+ AIgathaVault contract - We designed the Vault Contract to store XXX token and lock ... until releasing token by period.

+ Ethereum Multisignature Wallet - 
# Token contract
XXX is [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20) standard token with the following paramaters:
+ Name: AIgatha token
+ Symbol: __XXX__
+ Decimals: __18__
+ Mintable: __No__
+ Burnable: __Yes__, owner can burn his tokens
+ Source Code: [AIgathaToken.sol]()
+ Mainnet address: [Not deployed yet]()
# Crowdsale schedule
Crowdsale rule for AIgatha project. It receives ethers and sends back corresponding amount of XXX tokens. Token price depends on the current phase (see the schedule). The following table contains a list of phases, each phase has a start time, end time and token price in ETH.
### Crowdsale schedule

|Phase|Ph.Name|Start date (UTC)|Start Unix|End date (UTC)|End Unix|Price, ETH|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Presale-1|2018-0X-0X 00:00:00|0000000000|2018-0X-XX 23:59:59|0000000000|14,000|
|2|Presale-2|2018-0X-0X 00:00:00|0000000000|2018-0X-XX 23:59:59|0000000000|12,500|
|3|Presale-3|2018-0X-0X 00:00:00|0000000000|2018-0X-XX 23:59:59|0000000000|11,500|
|4|Publicsale-1|2018-0X-0X 00:00:00|0000000000|2018-0X-XX 23:59:59|0000000000|10,500|

### Crowdsale schedule modification

After the end of crowdfunding, if the threshold is not reached, the crowdfunding period will only be extended once.
```ruby
function extendSaleTime() onlyOwner public {
  require(!saleActive());
  require(!extended);
  require(supply() >= threshold);
  extended = true;
 Â endDate += 60 days;
}
```
# Crowdsale Specification

+ AIgatha token is ERC-20 compliant.
+ AIgatha token is hardcapped at 2 billion tokens.
+ AIgatha token is non-mintable.
+ Any excess token will be locked by the owner at the end of the crowdsale.
+ AIgatha tokens will be released at period of the crowdsale but be transferable only after the crowdsale ends.
+ __Presale__ contributors are required to be whitelisted.
+ Extending the crowdsale for two months if the threshold is not reached.
+ Token sales threshold is 0.4 billion AIgatha tokens.

### Token Distribution

# Smart Contracts Code
### Development Framework
> + The safeMath library and Ownable contract are referred to openZeppelin
> + tokenRecipient is the contract interface which is comply with `receiveApproval` and used by `approveAndCall`
> + TokenERC20 is the contract standard ERC20 token with burnable functions 

### AIgathaToken Contract Functions
Documentation are listed as follows. 
+ `supply()` : return the remaining sales cap at the calling moment. It can be used internally.
+ `saleActive()` : to see whether it is on-sale or not.
+ `extendSaleTime()` : extend the sales time if the sold amount is not achieve the threshold amount set in the beginning. By calling this function, it will extend the sale time 2 months more. It can only be called by owner.
+ `getRateAt(at)` : get the exchange rate of ether to token at `at` time.
+ `push(buyer, amount)` : push `amount` to `buyer` who bought the token in preICO by owner.
+ `buyTokens(sender, value)` : `sender` uses `value` ether to buy tokens with rate obtained from `getRateAt()` 
+ `withdraw()` : withdraw all ether in the contract back to the wallet where save the whole funds. This function can only be called by owner.
+ `finalize()` : owner burn all the remain token which is unsold after the selling period and make token capable of being tranferred.
+ `functioni()` : fallback function which will redirect to `buyToken()`.

### AIgathaVault Contract Functions
> It is used to lock the `unlockAmount` of token in `wallet` every `unlockPeriod`. 
> Therefore, one wallet should correspond to one contract like this Basic token locker which can only be operated by owner.

+ Documentation are listed as follows.
+ `claim()` : owner claim that all `unlockAmount` of token can be sent to wallet after `unlockPeriod` passed by.
+ `withdraw(amount)` : owner withdraw `amount` of token, which is part of `unlockAmount` , to wallet after `unlockPeriod` passed by.
